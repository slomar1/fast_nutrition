Project: "Meal-Finder-CLI"

A simple command-line tool to help college students find fast-food options that meet their nutritional goals. This is the "pre-pre-alpha" version, focusing on core logic.


MVP Goal (Version 0.1)
Create a command-line program that lets a user define a nutritional target (e.g., "max 600 calories" or "min 30g protein") and searches a small, built-in list of food items to find matches.

V0.1 Roadmap: The "To-Do" List

[✅] Step 1: Project Setup
[✅] Step 2: Define Principle Data Structure
[✅] Step 3: Create a "Mock" Database and Hard-Code it in (Do NOT use an API yet)
[✅] Step 4: Build the Core Search Logic (Start simple: Use Basic Functions
[✅] Step 5: Build the User Interface (CLI. Use simple 'print' and 'input' statements, welcome message, menu options, error handling, etc.)


Future Goals (V0.2 and Beyond)

Once you've finished the V0.1 to-do list, *then* you can start on these harder features.

[ ] Integrate the USDA API:
  * [ ] Learn how to get an API key for the USDA FoodData Central.
  * [ ] Learn how to make an HTTP request (e.g., using `requests` in Python or `fetch` in Node.js).
  * [ ] Replace your "Mock Database" with live calls to the API.
[ ] Improve Search: Allow the user to combine searches (e.g., "max 600 calories" *AND* "min 30g protein").
[ ] Web Version: Convert the project from a CLI tool to a simple website using Flask, Django, or Express.
